@task-execute-readme repo_directory={{repo_directory}} repo_name={{repo_name}} commands_json_path={{commands_json_path}}

Task name: task-execute-readme

## Description:

This task takes the commands extracted by task-scan-readme, determines which commands are safe to execute, and executes them in the repository directory. This task requires AI structural reasoning for safety classification and CANNOT be scripted.

## Execution Policy
** ⚠️ CRITICAL - THIS TASK IS NON-SCRIPTABLE ⚠️ **

This task MUST be performed using DIRECT TOOL CALLS and STRUCTURAL REASONING:

1. Use read_file tool to load commands from the file specified in commands_json_path parameter
2. Use structural reasoning to classify each command as SAFE or UNSAFE
3. Use run_in_terminal tool to execute SAFE commands individually
4. Use create_file tool to save execution results to JSON output
5. Use replace_string_in_file tool to update progress/results files

** NEVER create a Python script for this task **
** NEVER batch-execute commands in a single script **
** EACH command must be evaluated individually for safety **

The AI agent must use reasoning to determine command safety and execute safe commands one at a time.

## Instructions (Follow this Step by Step)
### Step 1 (MANDATORY)
DEBUG Entry Trace: 
   If DEBUG=1, print: `[debug][task-execute-readme] START repo_directory='{{repo_directory}}'
   commands_json_path='{{commands_json_path}}'`

### Step 2 (MANDATORY)
Input Parameters:
   - repo_directory: absolute path to repository root
   - repo_name: repository name
   - commands_json_path: path to the JSON file containing extracted commands (from task-scan-readme output)
     Example: "output/{repo_name}_task3_scan-readme.json"

Prerequisites Check:
   - Use read_file to load the file specified in commands_json_path parameter
   - Extract the commands_extracted array from the JSON
   - If @task-scan-readme was SKIPPED (no README) or FAIL, skip execution
   - If DEBUG=1, print: `[debug][task-execute-readme] loaded {{command_count}} commands from {{commands_json_path}}`
   - If no commands or scan failed, set status=SKIPPED and proceed to output
   - If commands available, proceed with safety classification

Pre-flight Checklist Verification:
    - Open `tasks/{{repo_name}}_repo_checklist.md`
    - Confirm the `## Repo Variables Available` section contains the templated tokens below before making any changes:
     * `{{executed_commands}}`
     * `{{skipped_commands}}`
    - If any token is missing or altered, restore it prior to continuing



### Step 3 (MANDATORY)
Structural Reasoning - Safety Classification:
   
   For EACH command in commands_extracted array, use AI reasoning to determine if it is SAFE or UNSAFE.
   
   **SAFE Commands** (non-destructive, standard setup, low risk):
   
   a. **Package Manager Installs** (read-only or controlled installation):
      - `npm install`, `npm ci`, `yarn install`, `yarn`
      - `pip install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
      - `dotnet restore`, `nuget restore`
      - `composer install`, `bundle install`
      - `go get`, `cargo build`
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] SAFE [package_install]: {{command}}`
   
   b. **Version Checks** (read-only, informational):
      - `node --version`, `npm --version`, `python --version`, `pip --version`
      - `dotnet --version`, `git --version`, `java -version`
      - `msbuild -version`, `gcc --version`
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] SAFE [version_check]: {{command}}`
   
   c. **Configuration Reads** (non-modifying queries):
      - `git config --list`, `git config --get user.name`
      - `npm config list`, `npm config get registry`
      - Environment variable reads: `echo $PATH`, `$env:PATH`
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] SAFE [config_read]: {{command}}`
   
   d. **Non-Destructive File Operations**:
      - Directory listing: `ls`, `dir`, `tree`
      - Directory navigation: `cd <path>` (safe when used to set context)
      - File reading: `cat`, `type`, `Get-Content` (read-only)
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] SAFE [file_read]: {{command}}`
   
   e. **Environment Variable Assignment** (local scope):
      - `export VAR=value` (Bash/sh)
      - `$env:VAR='value'` (PowerShell)
      - `set VAR=value` (CMD - local scope)
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] SAFE [env_var]: {{command}}`
   
   f. **Safe Directory Creation** (non-destructive):
      - `mkdir <name>` (creating directories is generally safe)
      - `New-Item -Type Directory`
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] SAFE [mkdir]: {{command}}`
   
   **UNSAFE Commands** (destructive, modifying, risky, or out-of-scope):
   
   a. **File Deletion/Modification**:
      - `rm`, `del`, `Remove-Item`, `rmdir`
      - `mv`, `move`, `ren`, `rename`
      - `cp -f`, `copy /Y` (overwriting files)
      - Reason: "destructive_file_operation"
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] UNSAFE [destructive]: {{command}}`
   
   b. **System/Permission Modifications**:
      - `sudo <anything>`, `su`
      - `chmod`, `chown`, `icacls`
      - `setx` (permanent environment variables)
      - Reason: "system_modification"
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] UNSAFE [system_mod]: {{command}}`
   
   c. **Network Operations** (downloading executables, security risk):
      - `curl <url> | sh`, `wget <url> | bash`
      - `Invoke-WebRequest <url> -OutFile <exe>`
      - Downloading .exe, .msi, .sh, .bat files
      - Reason: "network_download_execute"
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] UNSAFE [network]: {{command}}`
   
   d. **Build/Compile Commands** (handled by other workflow tasks):
      - `msbuild`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet publish`
      - `npm run build`, `npm run start`, `yarn build`
      - `make`, `cmake`, `gradle build`
      - `mvn compile`, `ant build`
      - Reason: "build_command_handled_elsewhere"
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] UNSAFE [build]: {{command}}`
   
   e. **Database Operations**:
      - `DROP`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `TRUNCATE`
      - `mongod`, `mysqld`, database server start commands
      - Reason: "database_operation"
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] UNSAFE [database]: {{command}}`
   
   f. **Ambiguous/Complex Commands**:
      - Commands with shell redirects that modify files: `> file.txt`
      - Pipes to unknown executables: `| unknown-tool`
      - Complex chained commands: `cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3` (evaluate each separately)
      - Reason: "ambiguous_safety"
      - If DEBUG=1: `[debug][task-execute-readme] UNSAFE [ambiguous]: {{command}}`
   
   **Safety Decision Logic**:
   - When in doubt, classify as UNSAFE
   - Consider command category from task-scan-readme output
   - Consider context from README (is it clearly a setup step?)
   - Check for command flags that change behavior (e.g., `rm -rf` vs `ls -l`)
   - If command does multiple things (chained with && or ;), evaluate each part

### Step 4 (MANDATORY)
  Command Execution** (SAFE commands only):
   
   For each SAFE command:
   
   a. Pre-execution:
      - If DEBUG=1, print: `[debug][task-execute-readme] executing command [{{safety_category}}]: {{command}}`
      - Determine appropriate shell: PowerShell (pwsh) for PowerShell syntax, bash/sh for Unix syntax, cmd for Windows batch
   
   b. Execution:
      - Use run_in_terminal tool to execute command in {{repo_directory}}
      - Execute command synchronously (wait for completion)
      - Capture stdout, stderr, and exit code
      - Set timeout: 5 minutes (to prevent hanging on interactive commands)
   
   c. Post-execution:
      - If DEBUG=1, print: `[debug][task-execute-readme] command exit_code={{exit_code}}`
      - If exit_code != 0 and DEBUG=1, print: `[debug][task-execute-readme] command failed, stderr: {{stderr[:200]}}`
      - Record result in executed_commands array
   
   d. Log Command Execution:
      - Call @task-update-decision-log to log each command execution:
        ```
        @task-update-decision-log 
          timestamp="{{timestamp}}" 
          repo_name="{{repo_name}}" 
          solution_name="" 
          task="task-execute-readme" 
          message="{{command}}" 
          status="{{status}}"
        ```
        * timestamp: ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-10-22T14:30:45Z")
        * solution_name is blank since this is a repository-level task
        * message: the actual command that was executed
        * status: "SUCCESS" if exit_code is 0, "FAIL" if exit_code is non-zero, "TIMEOUT" if command timed out, "ERROR" if execution failed
   
   e. Error Handling:
      - If command times out: record as executed with status="TIMEOUT"
      - If command fails (exit_code != 0): record as executed with status="FAIL" (don't stop, continue with other commands)
      - If tool call fails: record as executed with status="ERROR"

**Skipped Commands** (UNSAFE commands):
   
   For each UNSAFE command:
   - If DEBUG=1, print: `[debug][task-execute-readme] skipping command [{{safety_category}}]: {{command}}, reason: {{reason}}`
   - Record in skipped_commands array with:
     - command: the command that was skipped
     - reason: why it was classified as UNSAFE
     - category: safety category (destructive, system_mod, network, build, database, ambiguous)
     - source_section: from task-scan-readme output

### Step 5 (MANDATORY)
   - If DEBUG=1, print: `[debug][task-execute-readme] execution summary: {{safe_count}} safe commands executed, {{unsafe_count}} unsafe commands skipped`
   - If DEBUG=1 and any failures, print: `[debug][task-execute-readme] {{failed_count}} commands failed during execution`

### Step 6 (MANDATORY)
Structured Output: Save JSON object to output/{repo_name}_task4_execute-readme.json with:
   - repo_directory: echoed from input
   - repo_name: echoed from input
   - total_commands_scanned: from task-scan-readme
   - safe_commands_count: number of SAFE commands
   - unsafe_commands_count: number of UNSAFE commands
   - executed_commands: array of objects:
     - command: the command executed
     - safety_category: SAFE classification reason
     - exit_code: exit code from execution
     - stdout: captured stdout (truncate to 1000 chars if longer)
     - stderr: captured stderr (truncate to 1000 chars if longer)
     - status: SUCCESS | FAIL | TIMEOUT | ERROR
     - execution_time_seconds: how long it took
   - skipped_commands: array of objects:
     - command: the command that was skipped
     - safety_category: UNSAFE classification reason
     - reason: detailed reason for skipping
     - source_section: which README section it came from
   - status: SUCCESS (if execution completed, even if some commands failed)
   - timestamp: ISO 8601 format datetime

### Step 7 (MANDATORY)
Result Tracking:
   - Use create_file or replace_string_in_file to append the result to:
     - results/repo-results.csv (CSV row)
   - Row format: timestamp | repo_name | task-execute-readme | status | symbol (✓ or ✗)
   - Status is SUCCESS if execution completed (even if individual commands failed)

### Step 8 (MANDATORY)
Repo Checklist Update:
   - Open `tasks/{{repo_name}}_repo_checklist.md`
   - Set `[x]` only on the `@task-execute-readme` entry for the current repository
   - Do not modify other checklist items or other repositories' files

### Step 9 (MANDATORY)
Repo Variable Refresh:
   - Open `tasks/{{repo_name}}_repo_checklist.md` file
   - Confirm the `## Repo Variables Available` section still contains the expected templated tokens exactly as shown below:
     * `{{executed_commands}}`
     * `{{skipped_commands}}`
   - Update the following variables with the latest values produced by this task:
     * `{{executed_commands}}`
     * `{{skipped_commands}}`
   - Ensure each variable reflects the refresh results before saving the file

### Step 10 (MANDATORY)
DEBUG Exit Trace: 
    If DEBUG=1, print: `[debug][task-execute-readme] EXIT repo_directory='{{repo_directory}}' status={{status}} executed={{safe_count}} skipped={{unsafe_count}}`

## Output Contract:
- repo_directory: string
- repo_name: string
- total_commands_scanned: number (from task-scan-readme)
- safe_commands_count: number
- unsafe_commands_count: number
- executed_commands: array of execution result objects
- skipped_commands: array of skipped command objects
- status: SUCCESS | SKIPPED | FAIL
- timestamp: string (ISO 8601)

## Implementation Notes:
1. **THIS IS NOT A SCRIPT**: Use direct tool calls only
2. **Individual Evaluation**: Each command is evaluated separately for safety
3. **No Batch Execution**: Commands are executed one at a time using run_in_terminal
4. **Safety First**: When uncertain, classify as UNSAFE
5. **Context Awareness**: Use command category and source section to inform safety decision
6. **Failure Tolerance**: If a safe command fails, log it but continue with remaining commands
7. **Tool-Based Execution**:
   - Use read_file to load the file specified in commands_json_path parameter
   - Use AI reasoning to classify each command
   - Use run_in_terminal to execute each SAFE command individually
   - Use create_file to save output/{repo_name}_task4_execute-readme.json
   - Use replace_string_in_file to update progress tables
8. **Timeout Protection**: Set reasonable timeout (5 minutes) to prevent infinite hangs
9. **Output Truncation**: Truncate stdout/stderr to prevent massive JSON files
10. **Shell Selection**: Choose appropriate shell based on command syntax:
    - PowerShell syntax ($env:, Get-*, New-*) → pwsh
    - Unix syntax (export, ls, grep) → bash or sh
    - Windows batch (set, dir, type) → cmd
11. **Working Directory**: All commands execute in {{repo_directory}} context
12. **Error Logging**: Failed commands are logged but don't stop the workflow
13. **Parameter Usage**: The commands_json_path parameter specifies where to load commands - do not hardcode paths
